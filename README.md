# Pragmatic Web Framework Development

Django makes it easier to build better web apps more quickly and with less code.

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

# Git

Before starting everyones need to have a dedicated repository where every major step inside the code should be pushed.

That's the very basic 101 for developers so let's start now.

I've found that a lot of new programmers don't even use git and that's a huge mistake, because when you're code is broken you become crazy.

# Installation Django

`python -m pip install Django`
